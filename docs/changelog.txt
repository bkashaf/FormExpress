Current Release 0.3.5

Prompts are now <label> elements for better accessability - checkboxes and radio buttons will set/unset from prompt, other input's will gain focus.

New item type of Button - Default value should be 'button', 'submit' or 'reset'. Value will be displayed on button and used for value attribute.

User entered value for input named 'replyto_email' will be used as 'Reply-To:' for easier response to enquiries ('From:' will still show site admin).

Sent mail only shows fields which have values.

Fixed block display (did not load FXHtml class, so hard-coded module name in include path).

Fixed radio input tab indexing.

Fixed invalid nested table layouts.

Fixed <fieldset> handling - note cannot create well formed html unless you expilcitly create  a GroupEnd for each GroupStart.

Nice sexy icons for admin page (not).

Better grouping/order for item type select list.

Added some inline help text for item create/modify.

Added Klavs' security call so viewing of forms can be restricted (by form ID).

Release 0.3.3

Things done by new maintainer Klavs Klavsen:

Fixed bug in pntables.php that was overlooked by versions of PHP prior to
php-4.3.5 - bug found and fixed by Øivind at canvas.anubix.net (Thank you!)

Fixed uploading (ie. import) of formexpress forms. It didn't work with never
versions of php (with register_globals turned off? - I forget :)

Changed default form-type to www-url-encoded - to allow for image uploading with
Formexpress forms.

Things done by previous maintainer Philip Fletcher: (0.3.3_rc1)

You can set 'item attributes' i.e. class="your_css_class".

Tab index works correctly within FE i.e. your cursor will tab from
the first FE field to the last FE field correctly.  Once outside the 
'FE zone' tabindex will be reset for each pnHTML instatiation.

0 (zero) can be entered in a required field (Bug report: Jørn Lind)

Import should now read binary safe on Windows
Upload of import file should now work for Win32. Fix by Jason Earl
Fix to Export (if > 1) Jason Earl

Can add items at any place in the form (not just at the end)

Some work arounds/recoding to allow FormExpress to run on PHP 4.0.6

More translation variables

Release 0.3.2

Fixed bug where parse of dynamic syntax failed if there where zeros in the
string (evaluates to false in PHP)

Release (0.3.1)

Fixed bug which stopped calls to non FormExpress modules:
{AnyModule:anyfunction&anyvars...} or just {AnyModule}
provided the Module implements the new module APIs (which most of the interesting stuff doesn't yet).

Added ability to call any url as an interim measure:
{FormExpress:showPage&page_url='http://www.stutchbury.net'}
for an external page, or:
{FormExpress:showPage&page_url='modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=index'}
to get at some of the legacy stuff.


Release 0.3.0

Database Cacheing of Form definitions for better performance 

Import/Export of Form definitions

Field validation by ereg, preg and dynamic function calls.

Dynamic function calls for defaults etc. (Nesting allowed)

NOTE: This uses the 'create_function' function and according to the 
online php manual:
"It should be noted that this function doesn't appear to work if Zend
Optimizer is in use - causes PHP to segfault."
I'm hoping this is fixed now 'cos Form Submit uses it too...

Can now have a Form in a Sideblock

Can now specify [FormExpress] as home page - set default Form in Configuration
