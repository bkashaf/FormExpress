Version 0.3.5

Install
Please see FAQ at http://www.stutchbury.net

Upgrade
This is alpha software; The upgrade process is NOT supported; please don't 
send me bug reports, questions etc (on the upgrade process). However...  

0.3.2 or 0.3.3_rc1 to 0.3.5 is a code only upgrade, so just untar/unziping to the file system should suffice.
